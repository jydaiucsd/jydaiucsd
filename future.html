										<h1>Future</h1>

									<p>The future of autonomous vehicles is an exciting one full of endless possibilities. As of right now, there is no true level 5 autonomous vehicles where no human interaction is needed. While some see the vehicle that doesn’t require any human interaction to be the end goal, there are different perspectives regarding the politics and safety behind it.</p>
									<p>For one, if an autonomous vehicle is proven to be “better” than a human than driving, then should a human should be allowed to drive at all? The proposition that humans shouldn’t be allowed to drive often is very polarizing as giving up the freedom to drive is one that will not be easily surrendered. Often when envisioning a utopia that contains self-driving cars, we think of a perfect system where the cars can talk to each one another. By doing so, traffic lights would be obsolete as there would be no need to control the flow of traffic manually. All these ideas seem out of this world right now, but the future comes fast with no idea being too ridiculous.</p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/crash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Another debate that results from autonomous vehicles is what happens when it does mess up. Who is to blame if there is technically no driver involved? This is not simply a theoretical debate as this is an issue that has real world consequences and has already occurred. For example, during Uber’s testing of their autonomous vehicle, the car struck a human resulting in a fatality. Though the car was technically not fully autonomous and had a test driver, it still raises the debate of liability. </p>
									<p>Further than simply liability sake are the ethics behind an autonomous vehicle’s decision making. In a situation where the vehicle must make a decision between protecting the occupants or protected a pedestrian, how will it choose whose safety is more valuable? When discussing ethics and machine learning, it is important to consider all possibilities in order to be a responsible data scientist. </p>
									<p>While the future of the autonomous vehicle is exciting with many possibilities, it is important to understand the setbacks that still lie ahead for the autonomous vehicles. Often with new technology, regulation comes after the consequences rather than proactive discussion. For a successful future for the autonomous vehicle, there needs to be discussion before the consequences occur.</p>
