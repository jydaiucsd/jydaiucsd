									<p>The Nova Documentary The Great Robot Race is one of my favorites as it provides a good understanding of how autonomous vehicles work and is a good account of the DARPA Grand Challenge. The Grand Challenge can be considered
									a milestone event in the world of autonomous vehicle development as it is one of the earliest government funded programs with the intentions of developing autonomous vehicle technology. The documentary does a good job
									dveloping a narritive following the teams participating in the challenge itself. The documentary's purpose of educating an audience is accompished well through an easy to understand and captivating story that does not
									require any previous background knowledge to understand and enjoy. One con of this documentary is that it is outdated and the technology has progressed since then. The one setback when discussing the forefront of technology
									is that the information can always be quickly outdated. As a result, the documentary does not cover many of the newer companies that did not exist almost 15 years ago when it was filmed. All in all, it is a very informative
									and entertaining resource to help understand how autonomous vehicles are developed. </p>
