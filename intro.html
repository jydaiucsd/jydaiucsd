								<p>Since the beginning of the automobile, the dream of a car which can drive itself has always existed. Once thought to be a sci-fi dream, the reality of a self-driving car becomes more real every day. Of course, the self-driving car may be rooted in fiction, but current technology makes it closer to reality day by day.</p>
								<p>Through key developments in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, the integration between a system which can replicate human cognition and vehicles are helping develop the first self-driving cars. As data science is still a rapidly growing field, resources detailing how data science interacts with the automotive industry are not as abundant. </p>	
								<p>This site intends to serve as a learning resource about autonomous vehicles and the intersection between the autonomous vehicles and data science/machine. Organized below are sections covering the past, present, and future of Autonomous vehicles as well as a brief introduction to the topics of data science and machine learning.</p>	
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Past</h3>
												<p>Starting from the past, explore the origins and history of the autonomous vehicle. From the very beginnings to the significant milestones, this section covers it all to see how the dream of the autonomous vehicle has evolved over time through evolutions of all different forms</p>	
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Present</h3>
												<p>Within the present section, learn more about whatâ€™s currently happening regarding autonomous vehicles. Learn about the companies all racing to be at the forefront of innovation as well as the progress that has been made. See how data science and machine learning are being integrated within the autonomous vehicles of today as a crucial key to their success. </p>	
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Future</h3>
								<p>Finally, in the future section, learn more about where the future of the autonomous vehicle is headed as relevant technologies help supplement the growth of autonomous vehicles.
